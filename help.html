      <p>The inner voices of anorexia and bulimia whisper that you’ll never be happy until you lose weight, that your worth is measured by how you look. But the truth is that happiness and self-esteem come from loving yourself for who you truly are—and that’s only possible with recovery. </p>

      <p>The road to recovery from an eating disorder starts with admitting you have a problem. This admission can be tough, especially if you’re still clinging to the belief—even in the back of your mind—that weight loss is the key to your happiness, confidence, and success. Even when you finally understand this isn’t true, old habits are still hard to break.</p>

      <p>The good news is that the behaviors you’ve learned can also be unlearned. Just as anyone can develop an eating disorder, so too, anyone can get better. However, overcoming an eating disorder is about more than giving up unhealthy eating behaviors. It’s also about learning new ways to cope with emotional pain and rediscovering who you are beyond your eating habits, weight, and body image.</p>

      <p>
      <b>1. Find the person (or people) you trust. </b>
      The first step in asking for help is to confide in the person you trust the most. This can be a best friend, a close relative, a teacher, a sibling, or a parent. It is essential that you share your moments of struggle with the people you spend the most time with. This will allow them to be aware of environmental factors that may elicit destructive behaviors that can harm your health. <br><br>
      Although telling your family and friends may be the most difficult step in admitting you have an eating disorder, it is the most crucial step towards recovering from your eating disorder. Knowing that you are not alone in the struggle will make the journey towards recovery more meaningful.<br><br></p>

      <p>
      <b>2. Find a safe space and time to discuss your experience.</b>
      Because the people in your life may not realize you are struggling, finding the right time and place to tell them is an important step. Family members tend to be very busy with their own lives but you must remember that you are their number one priority. <br><br>

      Find a comfortable place that your family members typically gather in and engage them in a conversation about how you have been struggling but want help to overcome your disorder. Make sure that you pick a time and place where they have your full attention and are not distracted by jobs, school, or other activities. Be honest and tell them that you need their help to move on from your eating disorder and are finally beginning to understand your disorder.<br> <br></p>

      <p>
      <b>3. Understand that they may struggle with the shock.</b> The people you spend the most time with, such as close friends and family members, care about you and want to see you through. Take a leap of faith and share your experiences, why you may be struggling, and ask for advice on what to do in your moments of difficulty. They will be so happy that you trusted in them and although they may be shocked at first, they will do anything for you to get the proper help you need. <br><br>

      Make sure you communicate to your family and friends that you were trying to understand your disorder but knew you could not overcome it without their help. Be honest and open and you will be surprised at how much your family and friends will be thankful that you confided in them. <br><br></p>

      <p>
      <b>4. Seek professional help.</b> After confiding in close family members and friends, it is important that you take action and seek professional help. <br><br></p>
