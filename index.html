          What Are Eating Disorders?
        </div>

        <div class="text">
          Eating disorders are serious but treatable mental and physical illnesses that can affect people of all genders, ages, races, religions, ethnicities, sexual orientations, body shapes, and weights. National surveys estimate that 20 million
          women and 10 million men in America will have an eating disorder at some point in their lives.

            Anorexia Nervosa
          </div>
          <div class="ed_text">
            Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by weight loss (or lack of appropriate weight gain in growing children); difficulties maintaining an appropriate body weight for height, age, and stature; and, in many individuals,
            distorted body image. People with anorexia generally restrict the number of calories and the types of food they eat. Some people with the disorder also exercise compulsively, purge via vomiting and laxatives, and/or binge eat.

            DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

          <div class="ed_diagnose">
            1. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. <br>
            2. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight.<br>
            3. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight.

          <div class="ed_text">
            Bulimia nervosa is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by a cycle of bingeing and compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting designed to undo or compensate for the effects of binge eating.

            1. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. <br>
            2. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications, fasting, or excessive exercise.<br>
            3. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for three months.<br>
            4. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.<br>
            5. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.<br>

            Binge Eating Disorder
          </div>
          <div class="ed_text">
            Binge eating disorder (BED) is a severe, life-threatening, and treatable eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of eating large quantities of food (often very quickly and to the point of discomfort); a feeling of a loss of
            control during the binge; experiencing shame, distress or guilt afterwards; and not regularly using unhealthy compensatory measures (e.g., purging) to counter the binge eating. It is the most common eating disorder in the United States.

            2. The binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.<br>
            3. The binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors (e.g., purging) as in bulimia nervosa and does not occur exclusively during the course of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa.<br>

            Orthorexia
          </div>
          <div class="ed_text">
            Although not formally recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, awareness about orthorexia is on the rise. The term ‘orthorexia’ was coined in 1998 and means an obsession with proper or ‘healthful’ eating. Although being
            aware of and concerned with the nutritional quality of the food you eat isn’t a problem in and of itself, people with orthorexia become so fixated on so-called ‘healthy eating’ that they actually damage their own well-being.

            DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

            1. Compulsive checking of ingredient lists and nutritional labels <br>
            2. An increase in concern about the health of ingredients <br>
            3. Cutting out an increasing number of food groups (all sugar, all carbs, all dairy, all meat, all animal products) <br>
            4. An inability to eat anything but a narrow group of foods that are deemed ‘healthy’ or ‘pure’ <br>
            5. Unusual interest in the health of what others are eating <br>
            6. Spending hours per day thinking about what food might be served at upcoming events <br>
            7. Showing high levels of distress when ‘safe’ or ‘healthy’ foods aren’t available <br>
            8. Obsessive following of food and ‘healthy lifestyle’ blogs on Twitter and Instagram <br>
            9. Body image concerns may or may not be present <br>

            OSFED
          </div>
          <div class="ed_text">
            Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders (OSFED) was previously known as Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) in past editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. Despite being considered a ‘catch-all’ classification
            that was sometimes denied insurance coverage for treatment as it was seen as less serious, OSFED/EDNOS is a serious, life-threatening, and treatable eating disorder. The category was developed to encompass those individuals who did not
            meet strict diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa but still had a significant eating disorder. In community clinics, the majority of individuals were historically diagnosed with EDNOS.
