    <div class="title">Helping Loved Ones</div>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>People with eating disorders use food to deal with uncomfortable or painful emotions. Restricting food is used to feel in control. Overeating temporarily soothes sadness, anger, or loneliness. Purging is used to combat feelings of helplessness and self-loathing. Over time, people with an eating disorder lose the ability to see themselves objectively and obsessions over food and weight come to dominate everything else in their lives. Their road to recovery begins by identifying the underlying issues that drive their eating disorder and finding healthier ways to cope with emotional pain.</p>

      <p>Recovery is not easy. It takes lots of courage and patients. <br>Your support and enouragement along the way will make a big different.</p>

    <div class="subtitle"><h6>Tips</h6></div>

    <div class="tips">
      <li>Recognise that you are not to blame.</li><br>
      <li>Acknowledge to your loved one that they are not to blame.</li><br>
      <li>Recognise how distressing the illness is for your loved one.</li><br>
      <li>Educate yourself about eating disorders where you can.</li><br>
      <li>Ask your loved one how they are feeling and what they are thinking, rather than making assumptions.</li><br>
      <li>Avoid discussing weight, shape, food, and diets in front of your loved one, and model a balanced relationship with your own food and exercise.
      Remind yourself that things can change and reassure your loved one that recovery is possible.</li><br>
      <li>Ask your loved one what you can do to help – for example, helping them to stick to regular eating, putting in boundaries following mealtimes, having a space to talk about how they are feeling. Your loved one may respond that you can just “leave them alone” or that you can’t do anything to help, so here it can be helpful to remind them you can hear their distress and how difficult things are, and you are there if they need you.</li><br>
      <li>Recognise any ‘accommodating or enabling behaviours’ – behaviours that you do to help reduce your loved one’s distress from the eating disorder, for example, cleaning up vomit or cooking different meals for them, but that collude with the disorder and cover up the negative consequences of the behaviours.</li><br>
